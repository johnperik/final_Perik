			<img src="superbowl.jpg" alt="">
			<p>The Super Bowl is America's expression of patriotism and marks the most watched television show of the year. Last year’s Super Bowl (LV), marked the lowest rated Super Bowl in 14 years. This year’s ratings saw a bounce back as they increased by 8% compared to the year before. This year followed a continuous trend of the Super Bowl audience being larger than the sum of the AFC and NFC Championship games. This year the AFC Championship game generated 47.9 million people in viewership while the NFC Championship game generated 50.2 million which combined was still less than the Super Bowl. To put this significance in perspective, in 2021 the NFL only had 33 NFL telecasts with 20 million people viewing. This comes as Super Bowl ratings have been on a constant decline since 2014 when they reached a record high. The decline in 2021 can be attributed to the pandemic and a lack of Super Bowl viewing parties and bar closures and restaurant curfews nationwide.</p>

			<h3 class="subhead">The Story Behind Nielsen Holdings Data</h3>
			<p>The dataset(s) used to support this story both come from Sports Media Watch and were cited from Nielsen Holdings. They show the total ratings of the AFC and NFC Championship games and Super Bowl for a given year. There is one key limitation that this data does not account for – streaming viewers. As streaming platforms continue to become more and more popular, there is certainly a percent of viewers who are broadcasting the game via a streaming service rather than on cable television. Secondly, considering many people watch the Super Bowl in groups the ratings data may tell a different story than the overall viewership data which accounts for all people watching the television broadcast.</p>
